# mailproxee

An e-mail proxy management agent for mailprox.ee to increase privacy, combat spam and decrease the risk of tracking. Request an unlimited amount of unique and autogenerated e-mail addresses, which will forward all future incoming e-mails to your personal inbox, unless you say stop. Simply achieve this by writing an e-mail to the agent and then awaiting a response from the agent containing your unique autogenerated proxy e-mail address.

No proxy e-mail address will be used twice, when you have no more use for the address, request the e-mail address to be deleted.

## Why not just Gmail-like aliases?

Gmail aliases works by appending your own e-mail identifier using _+something_, e.g. appending _name@gmail.com_ with _+something_ to be _name+something@gmail.com_. This can be used to later catch simple spam by creating filters to delete anything sent to _name+something@gmail.com_.

This is a simple but fairly effective mechanism to counter simple naive spam, but it is easy to revert the alias to your actual e-mail address. It does little to hide your true e-mail address, allowing for easy tracking across services using a single unique identifier, your e-mail.
